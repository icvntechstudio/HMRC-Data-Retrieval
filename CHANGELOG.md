The search terms have been made more specific to better target companies in each category. For example:

- Changed generic "cleaning" to more specific terms like "general cleaning", "industrial cleaning", etc.
- Updated waste management terms to be more precise ("waste collection", "non-hazardous waste", etc.)
- Made service-specific terms clearer ("landscaping services", "business support", etc.)

This should help improve the search results by:

1. Better targeting companies in each specific sector
2. Reducing false positives from companies that happen to mention cleaning/waste in their descriptions
3. Capturing more relevant companies through specific industry terminology
