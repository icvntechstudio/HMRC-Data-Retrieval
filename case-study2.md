## Case Study: HMRC Data Retrieval Automation

### Objective  
The aim was to streamline the process of retrieving company data by automating interactions with the Companies House API and HMRC API. This eliminated repetitive manual tasks, ensuring faster and more accurate data processing.

### Challenges  
- Handling large datasets of company names.  
- Ensuring data accuracy and mitigating API response issues.  
- Structuring results for easy integration into other systems.  
- Rate limiting to avoid overloading the API.

### Solution  
A robust Python-based system was developed:  
1. **Input Processing**: Automates loading of company names from structured files.  
2. **API Integration**: Leverages the Companies House API and HMRC API to fetch comprehensive company data.  
3. **Error Handling**: Implements retry mechanisms and validation to ensure reliability.  
4. **Output Generation**: Provides clean, structured data suitable for reporting or further analysis.

### Features  
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets seamlessly.  
- **Accuracy**: Automates error checking to minimize human mistakes.  
- **Efficiency**: Significantly reduces time taken for manual lookups.

### Impact  
The solution enhanced productivity by automating data retrieval and reduced operational costs associated with manual processing. This also allowed stakeholders to focus on strategic tasks rather than routine operations.

### Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python.  
- **API**: Companies House API and HMRC API for data integration.  
- **Libraries**:  
  - **os**: For managing environment variables and file paths.  
  - **requests**: For making HTTP requests to the Companies House API.  
  - **logging**: To record and monitor the application's events and errors.  
  - **datetime**: For handling date and time operations.  
  - **timedelta**: For date arithmetic operations.  
  - **dotenv**: To load environment variables from a `.env` file.  
  - **csv**: For reading and writing CSV files.  
  - **time**: To manage delays or pauses in execution.

### Outcome  
By implementing this automated solution, users achieved a 64.19% improvement in efficiency for current leads, ensuring consistent data accuracy.
